# CoffeeCoProject
This Software is designed to help automate an ordering system amongst coffee shops. The software incorporates many different features like customizing a coffee order, earning and redeeming points for customer loyalty, tracking inventory, and order logs. This software is valuable for tracking inventory because the program starts by reading the current inventory. There is also an option to update the inventory in the inventory file automatically after each order is made. This will be beneficial for all coffee shops to keep track of inventory. Another file is also incorporated in this software which helps log all orders made each day, thus assisting in keeping track of each order and the number of orders made each day. The last file used is the customer loyalty file, which keeps track of customer points and is updated each time the customer redeems points in the gift shop. Lastly, this software allows the customer to customize their coffee order to exactly how they would like it, by incorporating many ingredients in this software the customer will have a variety of options to choose from. This program also allows the coffee management team to find errors efficiently due to the incorporation of the catch function which displays exactly where the error is being thrown.
